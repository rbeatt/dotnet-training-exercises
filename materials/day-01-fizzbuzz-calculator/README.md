Supporting materials for Day 1: FizzBuzz + Calculator.

Contents:
- worksheet.md: Scenarios and expected outputs for FizzBuzz and Calculator.
- hints.md: Tips and common pitfalls.

Notes:
- Students should explicitly identify FizzBuzz edge cases (e.g., zero divisors, negative divisors, equal divisors) and either validate inputs or handle them gracefully.
- If adding logging with Serilog, default to console logging. File logging to a local `./logs` folder is optional and should not be enabled by default.
